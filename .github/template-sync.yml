# Target repositories to push terraform-only plumbing (no sync logic; they are not template repos).
repositories:
  - "terraform-github"
  # - "terraform-cloudflare"

# Only terraform-specific files. Do NOT overlap with what template-template syncs to us
# (dependabot-automerge, pre-commit-update, pre-commit, sync.yaml, .github/scripts/*).
# Include the terraform-setup action and terraform workflow scripts so child repos have them.
